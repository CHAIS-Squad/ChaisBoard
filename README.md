We recognize the frustration developers often face in navigating elaborate setups, and we aim to offer a solution that allows them to focus solely on showcasing their skills without any unnecessary barriers. By prioritizing simplicity and ease of use, our tool ensures that the whiteboarding process remains efficient, straightforward, and tailored to the immediate needs of developers, fostering a distraction-free environment for effective technical assessments.
